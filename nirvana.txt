NIRVANA.AI — Judge Briefing Deck (Text Version)

Executive one‑liner
NIRVANA.AI is a personal mental-wellbeing copilot that blends AI‑guided conversations, micro‑exercises, journaling, and daily self‑care into a single, privacy‑first experience.

What it does (features you can try today)
- Secure onboarding and access
  - Authentication via Clerk with protected dashboard routes and middleware guards.
- AI chat for mental wellness
  - A supportive chatbot powered by LLMs (Groq) with conversation history.
- Journaling, built-in
  - Create, view, edit journal entries with rich text, safe HTML viewing, and streaks.
- Micro‑exercise engine
  - Generate short, goal‑oriented wellness exercises (check‑in → Q&A/MCQ → reflection) and submit for personalized reports.
- Self‑care hub
  - Daily Uplift (bite-size positivity), Mindful Breathing (guided cycles), and Music Deck (mood playlists).
- Wellness Card
  - A snapshot of current wellness signals for quick insight.
- Insightful dashboard
  - Current messages, journaling streak, exercise streak, activity chart — designed for small, focused widgets.
- File and voice friendly groundwork
  - Upload pathway via multer (e.g., for future audio transcription scenarios).

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope
- App shell and routing
  - Next.js App Router with global and dashboard layouts; responsive sidebar and header.
- Core domains
  - Chat: send a prompt and receive an LLM response (per‑chatbot threads).
  - Journal: CRUD entries; list and detail views.
  - Micro‑exercises: generate session, run steps, submit, and view a report.
  - Self‑care pages: daily uplift, mindful breathing, music deck.
- Data flow and persistence
  - Backend REST API v1 on Express + Mongoose (MongoDB) with Joi validation.
  - Token‑intercepted axios clients on the frontend with a consistent HOST base URL.
- Auth & access control
  - Clerk front‑door, JWT middleware for backend protection, error handling, and clean JSON responses.

Why it’s unique in the current landscape
- All‑in‑one, habit‑forming design
  - Chat, journaling, micro‑exercises, and self‑care live in one coherent flow — not scattered apps.
- Micro‑exercise generation engine
  - Exercises adapt to a session goal, emotions, and self‑reported state; results feed a personal report.
- Judicious AI
  - LLM prompts are grounded by domain templates; validation and error middleware keep responses safe and structured.
- Privacy‑first architecture
  - Tokenized APIs, explicit auth boundaries, and server components where possible reduce client‑side exposure.
- Built for extensibility
  - Versioned APIs, constants‑driven schemas, modular routes/controllers, and typed data across the stack.

Real-world problems it solves
- Activation barrier: “I don’t know where to start”
  - Daily Uplift and guided breathing provide immediate, low‑effort engagement.
- Consistency gap: “I can’t keep a habit”
  - Micro‑exercises, streaks, and short loops build momentum in minutes, not hours.
- Reflection deficit: “I can’t make sense of how I feel”
  - Journaling + a wellness card encourages structured self‑reflection and trend awareness.
- Access inequality: “Therapy isn’t always accessible”
  - An AI companion offers timely, stigma‑free support between sessions.

How it works (architecture at a glance)
- Frontend (Next.js 14+, TypeScript)
  - App Router, server components by default; client components for interactivity.
  - Feature‑scoped components (chat, exercise, dashboard) + generic UI library.
  - Data‑access helpers (axios clients with token interceptor) to keep pages clean.
- Backend (Express, TypeScript)
  - /api/v1 with modular routes, controllers, models (Mongoose).
  - Validation via Joi; auth via JWT middleware; error middleware for consistent JSON.
  - LLM integration via Groq SDK with prompt templates and model constants.
  - Multer for uploads (extensible to audio → text transcription).
- Data
  - MongoDB for users, chats, journals, exercises, reports, and wellness snapshots.

Key user journeys (judge demo checklist)
1) New user → sign up/sign in → onboard → dashboard widgets appear.
2) Start a chat → get a supportive AI reply → see thread in chat view.
3) Create a journal entry → view it rendered safely → observe journaling streak.
4) Generate a micro‑exercise → answer steps → submit → view personalized report.
5) Visit self‑care → try mindful breathing cycles → check Daily Uplift.

Quality and safety guardrails
- Input validation: All critical endpoints use Joi schemas to reject malformed payloads.
- Central error handling: Standardized JSON error shapes prevent leaky stack traces.
- Authorization middleware: Protects private resources and injects user identity.
- Server components by default: Minimize client‑side data surface.

What success looks like (measurable KPIs)
- Day‑7 retention of new users.
- Weekly active journaling users and average entries per week.
- Exercise completion rate and average session duration.
- Chat helpfulness rating (thumbs up/down or short CSAT after replies).
- Streak growth (journal/exercise) over rolling 30 days.

Deployment/readiness notes
- Clearly separated frontend and backend packages; environment‑driven HOST URL.
- Bun‑friendly dev scripts on backend, Node/ts‑node compatibility retained.
- Biome for formatting; strict TypeScript for reliability.

Roadmap — near term (4–8 weeks)
- Personalization
  - Adaptive prompts based on recent journals; nudge engine for streak recovery.
- Rich analysis
  - Journal sentiment/tag extraction and private trends on the dashboard.
- Safer, smarter chat
  - Guardrails and citations for psycho‑education content; crisis‑support fallbacks.
- Mobile readiness
  - PWA installability, offline journaling, background sync.
- Accessibility & inclusivity
  - WCAG‑aligned UI patterns; multi‑lingual prompts and UI.

Roadmap — medium term (1–2 quarters)
- Care team bridge (with consent)
  - Export reports or share weekly summaries with clinicians/coaches.
- Exercise marketplace
  - Curated packs (sleep, stress, focus) with A/B tested outcomes.
- Voice in, voice out
  - First‑class audio journaling and TTS for exercises and chat replies.
- Insights and goals
  - Monthly wellness reviews, micro‑goals, and smart reminders.

Why we will win SIH
- Strong engineering foundations: versioned APIs, typed models, clean separation of concerns, and a modern Next.js front.
- Practical, human‑centric feature set that delivers immediate value in minutes per day.
- Clear safety posture with validation, auth, and error boundaries.
- A credible path to impact: measurable habits (journal/exercise), incremental insights, and extensible AI.

Judges: what to look for in our demo
- Speed from sign‑in to value (onboarding → useful action in < 60 seconds).
- Clarity and consistency in UI (server components + modular design).
- End‑to‑end flow integrity (frontend call → backend route → model → response → UI render).
- Evidence of thoughtfulness in safety and privacy.

Appendix — tech stack quick list
- Frontend: Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind/PostCSS, shadcn‑style components, axios with token interceptor.
- Backend: Express, TypeScript, Mongoose (MongoDB), Joi, Multer, CORS/Morgan, JSON Web Tokens, Groq SDK.
- Tooling: Bun (dev/build), ts‑node, Biome formatter.

Closing
NIRVANA.AI turns the small moments you do have into meaningful progress: a journal entry here, a 3‑minute exercise there, a helpful chat when you need it. It’s consistent, private, and designed to fit real life — not the other way around.
